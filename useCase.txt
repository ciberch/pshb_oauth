PubSubHubbub Generalization for Social Service Providers
=========================================================
If we define a Social Service Provider as a provider of user information which
enforces authorization to user's resources according to their privacy settings,
then we have the following three use cases.

- I as a Service Provider only support authenticated subscriptions so I know
that the Consumer will adhere to certain policies and has the user's permission.
- I as a Consumer wanting to synchronize my copy of the data want to be able
to get notified regardless of data type. This means we need to model all
resources not just feeds.
- I as a Service Provider need to syndicate deletions of data from Subscribers
and replacements.
- I as a Consumer want a more compact and simple format than Atom.
